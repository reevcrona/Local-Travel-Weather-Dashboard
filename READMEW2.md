Second Week: This is the planing phase for our project. We started a trello table during this phase. We also divided the work between our 3 team members. Jacob decided to do the input and the search comoponent. Lucas decided to do the departure component. And Gustav decided to do the weather component. We agreed that Jacob should start working on the functionality for his component in order for Gustav and Lucas to be able to use the coordinates for their components
